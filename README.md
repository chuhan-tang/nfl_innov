## Project Overview
This capstone project analyzes player data from Madden NFL 24 to predict football players' **total income**, defined as the sum of `total_salary` and `signing_bonus`. Although the data comes from a simulation game, it is partially based on real-life player characteristics and reflects general patterns observed in professional football. The goal is to identify key correlates of player income and provide insights for a general audience.
